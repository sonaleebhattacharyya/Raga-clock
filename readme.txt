About this Project: 

Idea: Indian ragas (melodic forms) are specific to times of day. I created a site that will allow users to choose a time of day and 
and see ragas appropriate to practice at that time. 

Technology: I created a database on bit.io which contains information about the ragas, including name, description, 
start and end time and url. 

Then I created buttons (specific to times of day) which access the database and find the appropriate raga (get request).

I also included a url of an artist performing this raga that the user can listen to. 

Finally, I created an input button where the user can modify the database by adding other ragas appropriate 
to that time of day (put request).
